# WordPress Plugin Boilerplate (Extended)

The WordPress Plugin Boilerplate (Extended) is based on [Tom McFarlin's](http://http://tommcfarlin.com/) [WordPress Plugin Boilerplate](https://github.com/tommcfarlin/WordPress-Plugin-Boilerplate). In addition to the great standards that it introduces, the extended version includes some extra goodies for developers such as Grunt, Coffeescript, Compass and others.

## Features

* The Plugin Boilerplate is fully-based on the WordPress [Plugin API](http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API)
* Uses [PHPDoc](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHPDoc) conventions for easily following the code
* Liberal use of `@todo` to guide you through what you need to change
* Uses a strict file organization scheme to make sure the assets are easily maintainable
* Grunt tasks to help you process Coffeescript and Compass
* Uses the [WordPress Settings Framework](https://github.com/gilbitron/WordPress-Settings-Framework) to make plugin settings simple as pie.
* Meta boxes and fields are easier than ever to create with [Custom Metaboxes and Fields](https://github.com/gilbitron/WordPress-Settings-Framework)
* Plugin can update directly from GitHub with the [WordPress GitHub Plugin Updater](https://github.com/jkudish/WordPress-GitHub-Plugin-Updater)
